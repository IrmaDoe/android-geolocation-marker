This is a small projet using phoneGap to build a geolocation marker. I'm using this projects to mark polygons in another application! This app let's you geolocate yourself and save that to a csv file, to be used later.
The csv file is called AndroidGeolocationMarker?.csv and is recorded on the root of the sd card!
Any problem open an issue or download the source and correct the bug yourself!
P.S.: This program is in portuguese! (Brazil)
